These will help you understand how various AWS services can be architected to build a solution while demonstrating best practices along the way. These examples are not intended for use in production environments.\nReady to get started? Let\u0026rsquo;s begin with Module 1: Introduction!\nafter setup there should be Modules for\nSome sort of the problem with mapping and why this was built? Exercise Workflow Exercise 1 - mapping the customer file Exercise 2 - mapping the watchlist file some sort of wrap up In each exercise we will have the same tasks (the overview will briefly describe the steps and tools)\nExamine the source data Provide or create the schema Use the senzing mapping assistant to map it Validate the mapping with the json analyzer Load the data in Senzing Take a snaphot Analyze the snapshot for stats and examples Review the examples with the mcp server by asking how and why questions Source Data (Your Format):\nCSV with columns like: customer_id, customer_name, dob, address, email\u0026hellip; May have organization-specific field names Mixed data quality and completeness Target Data (Senzing Format):\nJSON with standardized features: NAME, DATE_OF_BIRTH, ADDRESS, EMAIL\u0026hellip; Specific attribute names (NAME_FIRST, NAME_LAST, ADDR_LINE1\u0026hellip;) Clear distinction between matching features and payload data The Challenge Knowing which source fields map to which Senzing features, and how to transform the data correctly.\nFor each source field, you must decide:\nShould it be a Feature (used for entity matching)? Should it be Payload (stored but not matched)? Which specific Senzing attribute name is correct? Does the data need transformation (date formats, name parsing, etc.)? Example decisions:\nYour CSV has customer_name - should this map to NAME_FULL? Or split into NAME_FIRST and NAME_LAST? You have id_number - is this an SSN? Driver\u0026rsquo;s License? Passport? Your registration_date - is this legal entity registration or customer signup date? (Very different meanings!) Traditional Manual Approach Without AI assistance, data mapping typically requires:\nReading specifications - Understanding hundreds of Senzing features and attributes Making decisions - Determining appropriate mappings for each field Writing code - Building transformation logic Manual validation - Checking outputs meet requirements Iterative debugging - Finding and fixing errors Time cost: 3-6 days for a typical dataset with 15-20 fields\nThe AI-Assisted Solution This workshop teaches you to use the Senzing Mapping Assistant - a structured AI workflow that:\n✅ Reads specifications instantly - AI loads the complete Senzing spec into context ✅ Suggests mappings - AI recommends appropriate features based on your data ✅ Generates code - AI writes the mapper automatically ✅ Creates documentation - Mapping decisions documented as byproduct\nTime savings: Same work in under an hour\nImportant Caveat: AI is your assistant, not a replacement for your judgment. YOU still need to:\nUnderstand what your source fields mean Make business decisions about what should influence matching Validate that AI suggestions align with your requirements Correct AI when it misunderstands your data What You\u0026rsquo;ll Learn In this workshop, you\u0026rsquo;ll learn:\nThe Senzing entity model (Features vs Payload, entity types) How to work with AI to make mapping decisions A repeatable 5-stage workflow for any dataset Professional validation tools to verify correctness How to load and analyze entity resolution results Ready to understand Senzing\u0026rsquo;s data model?\nThe 5 Stages STAGE 1: INIT - Load Reference Materials You load the Senzing specifications and reference materials into the AI context. This gives the AI the knowledge it needs to guide you through mapping.\nWhat happens:\nLoad entity specification Load mapping examples Load validation tools Load identifier and usage type crosswalks Your role: Copy prompts to load files into AI context\nSTAGE 2: INVENTORY - Analyze Source Data The AI analyzes your source data schema to understand what fields you\u0026rsquo;re working with.\nWhat happens:\nAI reviews pre-generated schema file Identifies field names, data types, population rates Notes patterns and potential issues Your role: Provide schema file (generated by sz_schema_generator.py)\nSTAGE 3: PLANNING - Identify Entities and Sources You work with the AI to determine:\nWhat DATA_SOURCE value to use Are there multiple entity types in your data? Any special handling needed? What happens:\nAI asks clarifying questions You make business decisions Establish mapping strategy Your role: Answer questions about your data and business context\nSTAGE 4: MAPPING - Field-by-Field Decisions This is the core mapping work. For each source field, you and the AI determine:\nShould it be a Senzing Feature (used for matching)? Should it be Payload (stored but not matched)? Should it be ignored? What is the correct Senzing attribute name? What happens:\nAI suggests mappings based on field names and content You confirm or override decisions Handle edge cases (e.g., dynamic identifier types) Decide on data transformations (date formats, name parsing) Your role: Make informed decisions with AI guidance\nSTAGE 5: OUTPUTS - Generate Code and Documentation The AI generates production-ready deliverables:\nOutputs:\nMapper specification (markdown documentation of all decisions) Python mapper (executable code) Sample output (example mapped JSON records) README (usage instructions) What happens:\nAI writes the mapper based on Stage 4 decisions You run the mapper Validate output with linting and analysis tools Your role: Review generated code, run mapper, validate output\nWhy This Workflow Works Structured Decision-Making: Each stage has a clear purpose and deliverable\nValidation Gates: You verify correctness at each stage before proceeding\nIterative Refinement: Easy to go back and adjust decisions\nDocumentation Trail: Complete record of why each mapping decision was made\nProduction Ready: Output includes code, documentation, and validation\nThis isn\u0026rsquo;t just code generation - it\u0026rsquo;s AI-assisted decision-making with you in control. The AI guides you through the specifications and best practices, but YOU make the final decisions based on your understanding of the data.\nThe Full Prompt The complete Senzing Mapping Assistant prompt with detailed instructions for each stage is available at:\nworkshop/senzing/prompts/senzing_mapping_assistant.md\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll load this prompt in Module 4 when you start the hands-on customer mapping exercise.\nWhat to Expect in Module 4 In the next module, you\u0026rsquo;ll:\nLoad the Mapping Assistant into Amazon Q Developer Work through all 5 stages for the customer dataset Make real mapping decisions with AI guidance Generate a working mapper Validate your output with linting and analysis tools Estimated time: 60 minutes for complete customer mapping\nReady to learn about the validation tools you\u0026rsquo;ll use?\n"

	"content": "First: Examine Your Source Data Before generating the schema, you need to understand your data structure and business goals.\nOpen the customer CSV file:\nIn your IDE file explorer (left sidebar), navigate to:\nNavigate to the workshop/workspace/customers directory Expand the folder to see its contents Double-click customers.csv to open it in your IDE Review the data structure:\nScroll through the first 10-20 rows Note the column headers Observe data patterns and completeness Look for different customer types (Individual vs Company) Define your business objective: Are you trying to find duplicate customers? Will you match this against other datasets? What constitutes a \u0026ldquo;match\u0026rdquo; for your use case? Remember: You guide the AI - understanding your data and goals ensures better mapping results.\nGenerate a Data Schema Now that you\u0026rsquo;ve examined the customer data, you need to document its structure. A schema document provides essential information about field types, population rates, and sample values - critical details for accurate mapping.\nWhy Generate a Schema? When mapping data, AI needs to understand both the source and target schemas. However, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t upload entire data files to AI because:\nPrivacy concerns - Files may contain sensitive customer information Context limits - AI models have limited context windows and cannot process large files Accuracy - AI can infer schema from sample rows, but this is error-prone Instead, you\u0026rsquo;ll use the Senzing schema generator tool to create a comprehensive schema document that includes:\nField names and data types Population percentages (how often fields contain values) Sample values and ranges Field statistics Pro Tip: For complex schemas the tool cannot handle, locate the official schema documentation or ask AI to help extract schema information from documentation.\nGenerate the Schema with Amazon Q Ask Amazon Q to generate the schema:\nOpen Amazon Q Developer (click the Q icon in the left sidebar)\nTell Amazon Q: Generate a schema for the customer CSV\nSecurity Note: Notice that Q asks for your approval before running the schema generator. This is an important security feature - never give tools blanket access to run commands without review. Always verify what actions AI wants to take before approving.\nQ Developer will run the schema generator tool and create a customer_schema.md file in your workspace.\nReview Q\u0026rsquo;s response:\nQ Developer will run the schema generator tool and create a customer_schema.md file in your workspace.\nReview the Generated Schema Compare the actual schema with the AI summary:\nIn your IDE file explorer, navigate to workshop/workspace/customers/ Open customer_schema.md Compare the actual schema content with the AI summary below Does the summary match what you see in the file?\nSchema Analysis: 120 Records, 19 Fields The schema generator will show you detailed statistics for your customer data:\nCore Identity (100% population):\ncustomer_id - Unique record identifier customer_name - Full customer names customer_type - \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; (Individual/Person) or \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; (Company/Organization) Demographics:\ngender (17%) - Gender information (sparse) dob (53%) - Date of birth (moderate coverage) Location Information (varying coverage):\naddress (61%) - Street addresses city, state, zip_code, country - Address components Contact Information:\nphone (18%) - Phone numbers (sparse) email (38%) - Email addresses (moderate) Identifiers (30% population): The schema shows a dynamic identifier pattern with three related fields:\nid_type - Type code (PASSPORT, DRIVERS_LICENSE, SSN, NATIONAL_ID) id_number - The identifier value id_country - Issuing country This pattern means you\u0026rsquo;ll need special handling to map these to the correct Senzing features.\nBusiness/Operational Data:\nregistration_date (83%) - When customer joined account_status (83%) - Active/Inactive status account_balance (75%) - Current balance customer_tier - Customer classification Dataset Composition Entity Mix:\n114 Person records (customer_type = \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo;) 6 Organization records (customer_type = \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo;) Total: 120 records This mix means your mapper needs to handle both PERSON and ORGANIZATION entity types, mapping fields conditionally based on customer_type.\nData Quality Observations High-value matching fields: customer_name (100%), dob (53%), address (61%) Sparse fields: gender (17%), phone (18%) - less reliable for matching Good identifier coverage: 30% have government IDs Strong operational data: 75-83% coverage on business fields This schema document will guide the AI during mapping to make informed decisions about which fields to use for entity resolution.\nFallback: Use the Pre-Generated Schema If you encounter issues generating the schema, a pre-generated version is available in the solutions folder:\nworkshop/solutions/customers/customer_schema.md\nCheckpoint: You should have a customer_schema.md file that documents all fields, data types, and sample values from the customer CSV.\n"

You\u0026rsquo;ll explore statistics, understand match patterns, and investigate specific entity examples.\nPart 1: Take Snapshot Generate the Snapshot Ask Amazon Q: Yes to the prior question, or take a snapshot\nUnderstanding the Results Key Result: 120 records → 78 entities\nThis means Senzing identified 42 duplicate records (35% compression), consolidating them into their true entities.\nAI Analysis - Without You Even Asking Look at what Amazon Q has already told you, without you even asking:\nMost of your matches were made on name, address, and date of birth There are 31 simple duplications and 4 multi-record entities The compression rate was high - did you expect that? An interesting entity to check out is Entity 1, which has 5 records The Power of Proactive AI: The AI didn\u0026rsquo;t wait for you to ask questions - it analyzed the snapshot and surfaced the most important insights automatically. This is AI working for you.\nTraditional Analysis with sz_explorer Traditionally, you would use Senzing\u0026rsquo;s sz_explorer utility to review snapshots. You can still do this here!\nAsk Amazon Q: give me the command to open the snapshot with sz_explorer in a terminal using full paths to both\nOpen a new terminal:\nIn your IDE, open the terminal (View → Terminal, or press Ctrl+`) Paste and run the command Q provides This is the traditional exploratory data analysis (EDA) interface. It provides a command-line menu system to explore entities, relationships, and statistics.\nTraditional Workflow: The sz_explorer tool is documented in the Senzing EDA guide. While powerful, it requires learning menu navigation and command syntax.\nIntroducing Senzing\u0026rsquo;s MCP Server! Here\u0026rsquo;s where it gets really cool. A snapshot only contains stats and entity IDs - no PII. That\u0026rsquo;s where the MCP server comes in. Let\u0026rsquo;s try a couple of things.\nWe already know that Entity 1 is the most interesting entity in the snapshot. So let\u0026rsquo;s start there.\nAsk Amazon Q: who is entity 1\nJust like that, Q queries the Senzing MCP server and shows you the complete entity profile - all the records that merged, the features that matched, even the payload data. No command syntax. No menu navigation. Just ask.\nNeed Technical Proof? Ask Amazon Q: how did senzing resolve entity 1\nNow you see the step-by-step resolution logic - which records merged when, what features matched at each step, even the similarity scores. This is the kind of detail that used to require digging through logs or complex API calls.\nThe Questions Are Only Limited By Your Imagination Try some of these:\nAsk Amazon Q: what possible matches should I review and why?\nAsk Amazon Q: show me that drivers license and dob match\nAsk Amazon Q: what relationships might qualify for a household and why? Can't just be same address, can it?\nNatural Language Exploration: That last question about households? I had to refine it a bit to get exactly what I wanted. That\u0026rsquo;s the beauty of conversational AI - you can iterate on your questions until you get the insight you\u0026rsquo;re looking for. Try it yourself!\nExercise 3 Complete! Checkpoint: You\u0026rsquo;ve captured snapshots, analyzed resolution statistics, explored the traditional sz_explorer tool, and used the MCP server to conversationally investigate entity resolution decisions.\nYou now have hands-on experience with the complete Senzing workflow - from mapping to loading to analysis. More importantly, you\u0026rsquo;ve seen how AI assistance transforms every step: from generating schemas, to validating mappings, to exploring resolved entities.\nThis is entity resolution, modernized.\n"

	"content": "The Power of Agentic AI Throughout this exercise, you experienced a fundamentally different way of working with development tools. Instead of memorizing commands, navigating file systems, and context-switching between documentation and implementation, you simply described what you wanted to accomplish.\nWhat Changed Traditional Workflow Friction:\n\u0026ldquo;What directory is that file in again?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What was the command syntax for this tool?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Where did I save that output?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What step comes next in the process?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How do I format this configuration file?\u0026rdquo; AI-Assisted Workflow:\nYou told the AI: \u0026ldquo;Generate a schema, map the customer data, validate it, configure the data source, and load it into Senzing\u0026rdquo;\nThe AI handled:\nLocating the correct tools and directories Constructing proper command syntax Managing workflow context across the conversation Handling environment-specific configuration Remembering what was done previously Determining the next logical step Time Savings Compound The efficiency gains aren\u0026rsquo;t just about individual commands - they multiply across the workflow:\nNo context switching: Stay focused on your data and business goals No documentation searches: Tools are invoked with proper syntax automatically No mental overhead: The AI tracks what\u0026rsquo;s been done and what comes next Fewer errors: Commands are constructed correctly the first time Better learning: Ask \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; questions instead of \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; questions This is the Promise of AI-Assisted Development Less time fighting with tools. More time understanding your data and achieving results.\nThe technical skills - command syntax, file paths, tool options - become less critical. The conceptual skills - understanding your data, asking good questions, validating results - become more important.\nThis shift lets you focus on what matters: your data quality, your business logic, your entity resolution strategy. The AI handles the mechanics so you can focus on the meaning.\nReflection Questions As you continue to the next exercises, consider:\nWhat surprised you about working with the AI assistant during this workflow? Where did you intervene to correct or guide the AI, and why was that important? What questions did you ask that helped you understand entity resolution concepts better? How might you apply this AI-assisted approach to other data projects? The AI is a Tool, Not a Replacement: Notice that throughout this exercise, YOU made the important decisions - what fields to map, how to handle edge cases, whether mappings made sense. The AI accelerated execution, but your judgment drove the outcome.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next: Ready to apply these skills to more complex data? The bonus watchlist exercise introduces international names, relationships, and nested data structures - all mappable with the same workflow you just mastered.\n"

You can complete the entire exercise by following this summary, or dive into the detailed pages for deeper exploration.\nQuick Start: This summary shows every prompt and action needed to map FTM watchlist data to Senzing format. Use it as a standalone guide or reference as you work through the detailed pages.\nImportant Notes Before You Start 1. Your Experience May Be Different This workflow shows what happened in a real mapping session, including:\nThe specific questions asked Corrections made when AI assumptions were wrong The context loss that occurred and recovery Your session will likely differ:\nAI might suggest different field mappings You may catch different errors Your data structure might require different decisions Context loss may happen at different points (or not at all) Use this as a guide, not a script. The principles are what matter, not matching it exactly.\n2. You Are In Charge Notice throughout this workflow:\nI directed the AI to things I knew about the data I questioned assumptions when I was uncertain I corrected errors when I spotted them I made final decisions on field dispositions Key examples:\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure those are all the identifier types, and how do you know?\u0026rdquo; → Found missing identifiers \u0026ldquo;previous name should be name_org, not name_full\u0026rdquo; → Corrected convention error \u0026ldquo;You say 3 master entity types but list 2\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; → Caught arithmetic mistake The AI is your assistant, not your replacement. You have the domain knowledge. The AI has Senzing knowledge. Together you make good decisions.\n3. What To Do If Things Go Wrong Context Loss (80% Warning)\nIf AI warns \u0026ldquo;Context ~80% full\u0026rdquo; and offers to compact: Say YES immediately If you decline: You will likely hit 100% and lose all context If context is lost: Use the recovery strategies in Step 6 Re-explore the repository Find artifacts (snapshot files, generated code) Reference documentation Continue from checkpoints AI Makes Wrong Assumptions\nQuestion it: \u0026ldquo;How do you know?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Are you sure?\u0026rdquo; Check actual data: Don\u0026rsquo;t accept answers based on schema alone Correct errors immediately: The earlier you catch mistakes, the easier to fix Validation Errors\nLinter fails: Fix JSON syntax errors in generated output Analyzer shows critical errors: Usually data source configuration - follow the fix steps Load fails: Check error messages for specific record issues Can\u0026rsquo;t Continue (Session Ending/Context Full)\nIdeally: Use /resume when you return (if available in your AI tool)\nIf no /resume available: Just give context manually and tell it what to do next:\nExample recovery (what actually happened):\nYou: \u0026#34;Its already loaded. can you find the snapshot on the watchlist directory and show it to me\u0026#34; AI: [finds snapshot file and shows it] You: \u0026#34;in the senzing tools reference it tells you how to summarize the snapshot, can you do that\u0026#34; AI: [proceeds with analysis] Simple approach:\nTell AI where you are: \u0026ldquo;Data is loaded, snapshot is taken\u0026rdquo; Tell AI what to find: \u0026ldquo;Find the snapshot file in workspace/watchlist\u0026rdquo; Tell AI what to do next: \u0026ldquo;Analyze it according to the tools reference\u0026rdquo; See Step 6 for the complete recovery example.\nStep Action / Prompt Used Reason / Outcome 1.

Recover Context New session - Prompt: \u0026ldquo;did you compact\u0026rdquo;\nAI: ❌ No memory of previous work Had to recover by finding snapshot file 11. Find Snapshot Prompt: \u0026ldquo;@senzing\u0026rdquo; [re-explore]\nThen: \u0026ldquo;do you still have access to the senzing mcp server?\u0026quot;\nThen: \u0026ldquo;Its already loaded. can you find the snapshot on the watchlist directory and show it to me\u0026rdquo; AI locates: ftm-watchlist-snapshot-2025-11-14.json 12. Analyze Snapshot Prompt: \u0026ldquo;in the senzing tools reference it tells you how to summarize the snapshot, can you do that\u0026rdquo; Result: 92 entities from 159 total records (42% compression), 17 cross-source matches 13. Find Multi-Source Entity Prompt: \u0026ldquo;show that multi source entity\u0026rdquo;\nAI uses: get_entity(91) via MCP server Discovery: Alexander Vasiliev spans CUSTOMERS, SANCTIONS, CORP_FILINGS with Cyrillic name variants 14. Resolution Timeline Prompt: \u0026ldquo;how did this entity come together\u0026rdquo;\nAI uses: how_entity_resolved(91) Insight: Cross-language name matching (Cyrillic→Latin) and international phone format variations 15. Map Relationships Prompt: \u0026ldquo;show his relationships in a simple graph view\u0026rdquo;\nAI uses: get_entity() calls for related entities Network: Alexander Vasiliev owns Mullenkrants Autoworks, Faisal Siddiqui is President Key Learning Points from This Workflow Interactive Decision-Making Notice the questions asked during Stage 4 mapping. These weren\u0026rsquo;t errors - they were quality checkpoints:\nVerifying assumptions against actual data Discovering edge cases (company relationships) Clarifying Senzing conventions (NAME_ORG vs NAME_FULL) Important: Asking questions improves quality BUT consumes context. Be specific with questions. If AI warns \u0026ldquo;Context ~80% full\u0026rdquo; and offers to compact, say YES - this compresses the conversation so you can continue. See Step 6 for what happens when you decline and context recovery strategies.\nMulti-Pass Processing FTM data required special handling:\nPass 1: Process master entities (Person, Company) Pass 2: Merge relationship metadata (Sanction, Ownership, Directorship) Pass 3: Merge identifiers onto Person entities Validation Pipeline Multiple validation layers caught different issues:\nLinter: JSON syntax and structure Analyzer: Data source configuration and feature coverage Loading: Actual entity resolution matching Entity Resolution Results The final numbers tell the story:\n42% compression - Significant duplicate detection 17 cross-source matches - Hidden connections revealed Multi-jurisdictional networks - Corporate structures mapped Next Steps: Continue to the detailed pages to see the full prompts, responses, and teaching moments, or jump straight to mapping your own FTM data using this workflow as a guide.\n"

	"content": "Understanding the FTM Watchlist Data Before mapping any data to Senzing format, you need to understand its structure. Unlike the customer CSV file in Exercise 1, this watchlist data is in FollowTheMoney (FTM) JSON format - a more complex format with nested structures and relationships.\nFTM Format: FollowTheMoney is an open-source data model designed for investigative journalism and anti-corruption work. It\u0026rsquo;s used by OpenSanctions, OCCRP, and other transparency initiatives to model entities, relationships, and sanctions data.\nExamine the Source File The watchlist data is located at:\nworkspace/watchlist/ftm.jsonl Format Characteristics:\nJSONL (JSON Lines) - One JSON object per line Nested structures - Complex objects with properties arrays Multiple schema types - Person, Company, Sanction, Ownership, Directorship International data - Arabic and Cyrillic character sets Relationship pointers - Entities reference other entities by ID Sample FTM Record:\n{ \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;sanctions-person-1006\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;schema\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Person\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;properties\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;Robert Smith Sr\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;firstName\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;Robert\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;middleName\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;E\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;lastName\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;Smith Sr\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;birthDate\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;1954-03-31\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;address\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;123 Main St, Las Vegas\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;phone\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;702-555-0123\u0026#34;], \u0026#34;email\u0026#34;: [\u0026#34;rsmith@example.com\u0026#34;] } } Generate the Schema Your Prompt:\nGenerate a schema for the ftm.jsonl file I have open AI Response:\nThe AI will run the schema generator tool:\npython3 senzing/tools/sz_schema_generator.py workspace/watchlist/ftm.jsonl -o workspace/watchlist/ftm_schema.md Why Generate a Schema? The schema generator extracts all field names, data types, sample values, and coverage statistics. This gives you and the AI a complete understanding of what data you\u0026rsquo;re working with.\nSchema Analysis Results Overview Statistics Metric Value Total Records 73 Schema Types 5 (Person, Sanction, Company, Ownership, Directorship) Unique Fields 31 Character Sets Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic Record Type Breakdown Schema Type Count Purpose Person 33 Individual entities (people) Sanction 17 Sanctions metadata for persons Company 6 Organization entities Ownership 8 Company ownership relationships Directorship 6 Company management relationships Complete Field Inventory Root Fields:\nid - Unique identifier for each record schema - Record type (Person, Company, Sanction, etc.) properties - Container for all attributes Person Attributes:\nname, firstName, middleName, lastName - Name fields birthDate - Date of birth address - Full address strings email, phone - Contact information nationality, country - Geographic data passportNumber, idNumber, taxNumber - Identifiers gender - Male/Female alias, previousName, weakAlias - Name variations Company Attributes:\nname - Organization name jurisdiction - Country of incorporation incorporationDate - Legal registration date address - Business address previousName - Former names Relationship Fields:\nentity - The subject of a sanction or relationship owner - The owning entity in an ownership relationship asset - The owned entity in an ownership relationship director - The person in a directorship organization - The organization in a directorship role - Management role (e.g., \u0026ldquo;President\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Principal\u0026rdquo;) percentage - Ownership percentage Sanction Metadata:\nprogram - Sanctions program name authority - Sanctioning authority reason - Reason for sanction listingDate - Date added to sanctions list startDate, endDate - Sanction period status - Active/Inactive Identifier Fields (nested in Person records):\nholder - Person who holds the identifier type - Identifier type (passport, SSN, driver\u0026rsquo;s license) number - Identifier number country - Issuing country Key Differences from Customer CSV Aspect Customer CSV (Exercise 1) FTM Watchlist (Exercise 2) Format Flat CSV (one row = one record) Nested JSON (arrays, objects) Complexity Simple - 19 fields per record Complex - 31 fields across 5 schemas Entity Types All in one file Separated by schema type Relationships None Explicit (Ownership, Directorship) Character Sets English only Multilingual (Cyrillic, Arabic) Processing Single-pass Multi-pass (merge relationships) What This Means for Mapping The schema analysis reveals several mapping challenges:\nMultiple Schema Types: Need to decide which are \u0026ldquo;master entities\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;metadata\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;relationships\u0026rdquo; Nested Structures: Properties are arrays, not simple strings Relationship Pointers: Some records reference other records by ID Mixed Entity Types: Both Person and Organization entities in same dataset International Data: Name transliteration and format variations Important: This is significantly more complex than the customer CSV! The FTM format requires a multi-pass processing strategy where you:\nProcess master entities (Person, Company) Merge metadata records (Sanction) onto masters Convert relationship records (Ownership, Directorship) to REL_POINTER format Next Steps Now that you understand the data structure, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to map it to Senzing format using the AI-assisted mapping workflow. The next section walks through the 5-stage Senzing Mapping Assistant process.\nPro Tip: Keep the generated schema file (ftm_schema.md) open in a separate tab. You\u0026rsquo;ll reference it frequently during the mapping process to verify field names, check sample values, and understand data coverage.\n"

	"content": "The 5-Stage Mapping Workflow Now that you understand the FTM data structure, it\u0026rsquo;s time to map it to Senzing format using the Senzing Mapping Assistant - an AI-guided workflow with 5 structured stages.\nAI-Assisted Mapping: The Senzing Mapping Assistant is a prompt-based system that guides an AI through the complete mapping process. It has access to all Senzing documentation, examples, and validation tools, making it an expert mapping partner.\nThe Five Stages Each stage has a specific purpose and validation checkpoints:\nStage Name Purpose Output 1 INIT Load reference files and test tools AI has complete Senzing knowledge base 2 INVENTORY Extract all fields from schema Complete field list with integrity check 3 PLANNING Determine DATA_SOURCE and entity types Processing strategy for complex data 4 MAPPING Map each field to Senzing format Field disposition: Feature, Payload, or Ignored 5 OUTPUTS Generate code and documentation Mapper script, spec, and sample output How This Differs from Exercise 1 Exercise 1 (Customer CSV):\nWalked through every prompt and response with screenshots Detailed explanation of each decision Every field discussed individually Exercise 2 (FTM Watchlist):\nShows key prompts and results Highlights decision points and corrections Demonstrates how to handle complex data You can complete this faster by learning from Exercise 1 patterns Efficiency Note: If you completed Exercise 1, you already understand the workflow. Use this exercise to see how the same process handles more complex data structures and relationships.\nStarting the Mapping Process To begin AI-assisted mapping, you need to load the Senzing Mapping Assistant prompt. There are two ways to do this:\nOption 1: Using the @ reference (if available)\n@senzing Option 2: Explicitly load the prompt file\nRead and follow the instructions in: /home/ubuntu/workshop/senzing/prompts/senzing_mapping_assistant.md Once loaded, the AI will guide you through each stage, asking questions and validating decisions along the way.\nWhat to Expect Interactive Decision-Making The AI will ask questions when it:\nNeeds clarification on field meanings Encounters low-confidence mapping decisions Finds conflicting or unusual data patterns Discovers edge cases not covered in examples Quality Checkpoints You\u0026rsquo;ll be prompted to verify:\nAll fields were extracted (no hallucinations) DATA_SOURCE codes are appropriate Field dispositions make business sense Sample JSON passes validation Iterative Corrections Don\u0026rsquo;t expect perfection on the first try! This exercise shows real corrections made during mapping:\nVerifying identifier types against actual data Discovering missed relationship patterns Clarifying Senzing conventions (NAME_ORG vs NAME_FULL) Important: The AI is knowledgeable but not infallible. Your domain expertise is crucial. Question assumptions, verify against actual data, and correct mistakes when you spot them.\nFollowing Along The next five pages show:\nPrompts used - What was asked AI responses - What the AI provided Your corrections - What was adjusted and why Final decisions - What was ultimately implemented Each page is standalone, so you can jump to specific stages to see how particular challenges were handled.\nPro Tip: Keep three tabs open:\nYour AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) The schema file (ftm_schema.md) The source data file (ftm.jsonl) This lets you quickly verify AI suggestions against actual data.\nReady?

Added 6 directorship relationships ✅ Generated 39 Senzing entities from 73 FTM records ✅ Output written to: ftm_senzing.jsonl 39 entities from 73 records: This is expected! Sanction, Ownership, and Directorship records aren\u0026rsquo;t separate entities - they\u0026rsquo;re metadata and relationships merged onto the 39 master entities (33 Person + 6 Company).\nStep 2: Validate JSON Structure (Linter) First validation: Check that the JSON is structurally correct:\npython3 senzing/tools/lint_senzing_json.py ftm_senzing.jsonl Expected Result:\n✅ PASSED - No JSON syntax errors All records have required fields (DATA_SOURCE, RECORD_ID) What the linter checks:\nValid JSON syntax (no missing commas, brackets, etc.) Required fields present (DATA_SOURCE, RECORD_ID) FEATURES array structure correct No obvious structural issues Step 3: Analyze Data Quality Second validation: Check that Senzing will recognize and use the mapped data:\npython3 senzing/tools/sz_json_analyzer.py ftm_senzing.jsonl -o analysis.md Important: According to the tools reference documentation, the analyzer outputs to a .md file.

Candidate Matches: 259 Senzing compared these new 39 records against:\nEach other (watchlist-to-watchlist matches) The existing 120 customer records (watchlist-to-customer matches) Generated 259 pairwise comparisons that met matching thresholds Ambiguous Matches: 5 Some records could match in multiple ways. Senzing flags these for human review:\nSame person with slightly different data in multiple sources? Actually different people who happen to have similar attributes? Legitimate uncertainty that requires business judgment Step 2: Take a Snapshot Capture the current entity resolution state for analysis:\nsource ~/.bashrc \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sz_snapshot -o ftm-watchlist-snapshot-$(date +%Y-%m-%d) -Q Expected Output:\nGenerating snapshot: ftm-watchlist-snapshot-2025-11-16.json Analyzing entity resolution statistics... Snapshot complete: Total data sources: 3 (CUSTOMERS, SANCTIONS, CORP_FILINGS) Total records: 159 Total entities: 92 Overall compression: 42.1% Cross-source matches: 17 ✅ Snapshot written to: ftm-watchlist-snapshot-2025-11-16.json What is a Snapshot? A snapshot is a JSON file containing comprehensive entity resolution statistics:\nRecord and entity counts by data source Compression rates (how many duplicates were found) Cross-source matches (same entity in multiple systems) Relationship counts Match quality breakdown (definitive, possible, ambiguous) Interpreting the Snapshot Statistics 159 Records → 92 Entities (42.1% Compression) What this means:\n159 total source records were loaded Senzing determined they represent only 92 unique real-world entities 42.1% of records were duplicates of entities already known 67 records merged into existing entities This is significant compression! Almost half the records were recognized as duplicates.\nCross-Source Matches: 17 What this means:\n17 entities have records from multiple data sources Examples: A person appears in both CUSTOMERS and SANCTIONS (watchlist hit!) A person appears in both CUSTOMERS and CORP_FILINGS (customer is a company officer) A person appears in SANCTIONS and CORP_FILINGS (sanctioned individual owns a company) These cross-source matches are the most interesting findings from entity resolution!\nStep 3: Quick Verification Verify the data loaded correctly by checking record counts:\nsource ~/.bashrc \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sz_explorer -query \u0026#39;DATA_SOURCE=SANCTIONS\u0026#39; Expected:\nShould return entities that have SANCTIONS records Verify some have merged sanction payload attributes Check that relationships are present source ~/.bashrc \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sz_explorer -query \u0026#39;DATA_SOURCE=CORP_FILINGS\u0026#39; Expected:\nShould return company entities Verify organization names appear correctly Check for ownership relationships Common Loading Issues Issue Cause Solution DATA_SOURCE not found errors Data sources not configured Re-run sz_configtool with data source commands All records fail to load JSON structure errors Re-run linter to find syntax problems Some records fail Invalid data in specific records Check error log for record IDs and field issues Load seems stuck Large dataset processing Be patient, or check with top command Duplicate record errors RECORD_ID collision Ensure RECORD_IDs are unique within DATA_SOURCE Success Indicators You know the load was successful if:\n✅ Records loaded = 39, Records failed = 0 ✅ Snapshot generates without errors ✅ Total entities \u0026lt; Total records (compression detected) ✅ Cross-source matches \u0026gt; 0 (found connections between data sources) ✅ Explorer queries return results for both SANCTIONS and CORP_FILINGS What Happens During Loading? 1. Record Ingestion Senzing reads each JSON record and extracts features and payload attributes.\n2. Entity Resolution For each record, Senzing:\nGenerates match candidates based on features (name, address, phone, identifiers, etc.) Scores each candidate match using ML algorithms Determines if record matches existing entity or creates new one Updates entity with new information from record 3. Relationship Processing For records with REL_POINTER:\nLinks entities together with typed relationships Builds network graph of connections Enables relationship path finding and network expansion 4. Indexing All features, payload attributes, and relationships are indexed for fast querying.\nKey Learnings Load Time Scales 39 records loaded in \u0026lt; 1 minute. Performance varies by:\nRecord complexity (features, relationships, payload) Dataset size (existing entities to compare against) Hardware (CPU, memory, disk) For reference:\nThousands of records: minutes Millions of records: hours (but can parallelize) Cross-Source Matching is Automatic You didn\u0026rsquo;t do anything special to enable watchlist-to-customer matching. Senzing automatically:\nCompared new SANCTIONS records against existing CUSTOMERS Compared new CORP_FILINGS against both CUSTOMERS and SANCTIONS Found matches based on feature similarity (names, phones, addresses, etc.) Compression Indicates Quality 42% compression suggests:\nGood data quality (clean enough to match) Realistic duplicates (not over-matching) Effective feature mapping (right attributes used for matching) Low compression (\u0026lt;10%) might indicate:\nVery clean, de-duplicated source data Under-matching (not enough features, or thresholds too strict) Very high compression (\u0026gt;80%) might indicate:\nVery dirty data with many duplicates Over-matching (false positives, thresholds too loose) Next Steps With data loaded and snapshot captured, you\u0026rsquo;re ready to analyze the entity resolution results in detail!\nThe next section demonstrates an important lesson about working with AI across sessions\u0026hellip;\nContinue to Step 6: Analyze Snapshot →\n"

	"content": "Analyzing Entity Resolution Results With data loaded and a snapshot captured, it\u0026rsquo;s time to analyze the entity resolution results to understand what Senzing found.\nIMPORTANT LESSON: Context Loss Across Sessions\nThis step documents a real scenario that happened during workshop development. The mapping and loading were completed in one AI session, then the session ended. When analysis resumed in a new session, the AI had lost all context about what had been done.\nThis section shows what happened, why it happened, and how to recover - a critical skill for working with AI on multi-day projects!\nWhat Happened: The Context Gap Original Prompt (New Session) did you compact AI Response I\u0026#39;ll explore the senzing directory to show you what\u0026#39;s available for the workshop. Problem: The AI didn\u0026rsquo;t know:\nWhat data had been mapped What files existed What work had been completed What \u0026ldquo;compact\u0026rdquo; meant in this context Why Context Was Lost In this case, context was lost because the context window filled up during the mapping conversation:\nLong Interactive Mapping Session\n5-stage mapping workflow with multiple questions and corrections Each question and answer consumed context tokens Asking questions improves quality but uses more context Data Loading Completed\nAll 39 records successfully loaded into Senzing ✅ Loading was done, data was in Senzing Next step should have been: take snapshot (Senzing analysis) Context Warning Appeared\nAI warned: \u0026ldquo;Context ~80% full\u0026rdquo; AI likely offered to compact (compress conversation to save tokens) This was the signal: say YES to compact Took a Chance\nSaid no / declined the compact offer Continued without compacting the conversation Kept going, probably asked to take snapshot Each additional message used more tokens Context filled to 100% → Session automatically reset All Context Lost\nWhen you asked \u0026ldquo;did you compact\u0026rdquo; - AI had no memory The conversation was never compacted (compressed) Session had reset, all context gone Had to recover from scratch Understanding \u0026ldquo;Compact\u0026rdquo; vs \u0026ldquo;Take Snapshot\u0026rdquo; THESE ARE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT:\nCOMPACT (AI Feature):\nAI action to compress/summarize conversation context Reduces token count by condensing the conversation Allows you to continue in the same session Prevents hitting the 100% limit Example: AI says \u0026ldquo;Would you like me to compact the conversation?\u0026rdquo; → Say YES! TAKE SNAPSHOT (Senzing Tool):\nSenzing command: sz_snapshot Analyzes loaded entities and generates statistics Creates JSON file with entity counts, compression rates, cross-source matches Has nothing to do with AI context management This is a data analysis step, not a context management step Compacting the conversation:\n✅ Prevents context loss by compressing conversation history ✅ Lets you continue in the same session ✅ Reduces token count so you have room to keep working ✅ Preserves enough context to maintain continuity The Lesson: Accept the Compact Offer\nWhen AI warns \u0026ldquo;Context ~80% full\u0026rdquo; and offers to compact:\nSAY YES to the compact offer AI will compress the conversation history This frees up tokens to continue working You can then take snapshot, analyze results, etc. in the same session DON\u0026rsquo;T decline and hope for the best - at 100%, session WILL reset automatically.\nIn this exercise: Data was loaded, ready to take snapshot. Context hit 80%, AI offered to compact. Should have said \u0026ldquo;yes, compact the conversation.\u0026rdquo; Instead, took a chance and declined. Kept going without compacting → hit 100% → session reset → all context lost.\nHow to Recover: Step-by-Step Recovery Step 1: Re-establish Context Your Prompt:\n@senzing AI Action:\nExplored the senzing directory structure Re-discovered reference materials, tools, prompts But still didn\u0026rsquo;t know what YOU had done Lesson: AI tools can rediscover the repository, but not your work history.\nRecovery Step 2: Verify Tool Access Your Prompt:\ndo you still have access to the senzing mcp server? AI Response: Lists all available Senzing MCP functions:\nsearch - Search for entities by attributes get_entity - Get full entity details by ENTITY_ID get_source_record - Get entity by source record ID find_relationship_path - Find connections expand_entity_network - Network analysis explain_why_entities_related - Explain matching logic how_entity_resolved - Resolution timeline Lesson: Always verify tool access after context loss. Different sessions may have different capabilities.\nRecovery Step 3: Locate Work Artifacts Your Prompt:\nIts already loaded. can you find the snapshot on the watchlist directory and show it to me AI Action:\nSearches workspace/watchlist/ directory Finds ftm-watchlist-snapshot-2025-11-14.json Reads the snapshot file Lesson: Reference actual files to restore context. The file system remembers what the AI forgot!\nRecovery Step 4: Understand the Snapshot Format Your Prompt:\nin the senzing tools reference it tells you how to summarize the snapshot, can you do that AI Action:\nConsults SENZING_TOOLS_REFERENCE.md Learns proper snapshot summary format Generates correct analysis table Lesson: Reference documentation helps AI understand formats even without prior context.\nThe Recovered Snapshot Analysis After recovery, the AI produced this proper summary:\nEntity Resolution Summary by Data Source Data Source Records Entities Compression Cross-Source Matches CUSTOMERS 120 75 37.5% 12 SANCTIONS 17 14 17.6% 5 CORP_FILINGS 22 17 22.7% 10 TOTAL 159 92 42.1% 17 Key Findings Overall Compression: 42.1%\n159 source records collapsed to 92 unique entities 67 records (42%) were duplicates of entities already known Cross-Source Matches: 17 entities\n5 matches between CUSTOMERS and SANCTIONS (🚨 watchlist hits!) 8 matches between CUSTOMERS and CORP_FILINGS (customers who are company officers) 4 matches between SANCTIONS and CORP_FILINGS (sanctioned individuals with companies) Relationships: 12 disclosed relationships\nOwnership connections (person→company, company→company) Directorship connections (person→company with roles) Multi-Source Entity: 1\nOne person appears in ALL THREE data sources (customer, sanctioned, company owner) How to Prevent Context Loss While you can\u0026rsquo;t always prevent sessions from ending, you can minimize recovery time:\n1. Document Progress Create markdown files tracking what you\u0026rsquo;ve done:\n# Create a progress log cat \u0026gt; mapping_progress.md \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;EOF\u0026#39; # FTM Watchlist Mapping Progress ## Completed Steps - [x] Generated schema from ftm.jsonl - [x] Ran 5-stage AI mapping assistant - [x] Generated mapper code (ftm_mapper.py) - [x] Validated with linter and analyzer - [x] Configured SANCTIONS and CORP_FILINGS data sources - [x] Loaded 39 records successfully - [x] Took snapshot: ftm-watchlist-snapshot-2025-11-14.json ## Next Steps - [ ] Analyze snapshot results - [ ] Investigate multi-source entities - [ ] Review relationship networks EOF 2. Save Key Information Keep a file with important paths and facts:\ncat \u0026gt; session_context.md \u0026lt;\u0026lt; \u0026#39;EOF\u0026#39; # Session Context ## Working Directory /home/ubuntu/workshop/ ## Key Files - Source data: workspace/watchlist/ftm.jsonl - Schema: workspace/watchlist/ftm_schema.md - Mapper: ftm_mapper.py - Output: ftm_senzing.jsonl - Snapshot: ftm-watchlist-snapshot-2025-11-14.json ## Data Sources Configured - SANCTIONS (DSRC_ID: 1002) - CORP_FILINGS (DSRC_ID: 1001) ## Load Results - 39 records loaded, 0 failed - 259 candidate matches evaluated - 5 ambiguous matches EOF 3. Reference Past Work When starting a new session:\nRead session_context.md and mapping_progress.md to understand what we\u0026#39;ve completed. Then help me analyze the snapshot at workspace/watchlist/ftm-watchlist-snapshot-2025-11-14.json 4. Use Persistent Artifacts Snapshots, logs, output files persist even when context is lost Generated code and documentation can be re-read File system is your \u0026ldquo;memory\u0026rdquo; across sessions Recovery Strategies Summary Strategy When to Use How It Helps Re-explore repository Always first step Reestablishes project structure Verify tool access When using special capabilities Confirms what\u0026rsquo;s available Reference file artifacts When work was saved to disk File system remembers your work Consult documentation When format is unclear Provides standards and examples Create context files Before session ends Saves time in next session Key Learnings Context Loss is Normal Don\u0026rsquo;t panic when AI doesn\u0026rsquo;t remember previous work. This happens to everyone. Having recovery strategies makes it manageable.\nDocumentation \u0026gt; Memory Files on disk are more reliable than AI memory:\nProgress logs Context files Generated outputs Snapshots and reports Incremental Recovery Works You don\u0026rsquo;t need to redo all the work:\nRe-establish basic context (explore repo) Verify tools still work Find artifacts from previous work Continue from where you left off Prevention is Easier than Recovery Spending 2 minutes creating a context file saves 20 minutes of recovery later.\nNow Back to the Analysis With context recovered and snapshot properly summarized, let\u0026rsquo;s dig deeper into the interesting findings using the Senzing MCP server!\nContinue to Step 7: Review with MCP Server →\n"

	"content": "Deep Entity Investigation Using Senzing MCP Now that context is recovered and you understand the snapshot results, use the Senzing MCP server to investigate specific entities, relationships, and resolution logic.\nMCP Server Advantage: While snapshots give you statistics, the MCP server lets you ask \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; questions about specific entities and matches. This is where AI-assisted analysis really shines!\nInvestigation 1: The Multi-Source Entity The snapshot showed 1 entity spans all three data sources. Let\u0026rsquo;s find it and understand how it came together.\nPrompt Show me the entity that appears in all three data sources (CUSTOMERS, SANCTIONS, CORP_FILINGS) AI Response Entity ID: 91 Resolved Name: ВАСІЛЬЕЎ Аляксандр Паўлавіч (Alexander Pavlovich Vasiliev)\nSource Records (3) 1.

This is exactly the kind of hidden risk entity resolution reveals.\nInvestigation 2: Resolution Timeline Understanding how this entity came together reveals Senzing\u0026rsquo;s cross-language and international format handling.\nPrompt how did this entity come together AI Response: Step-by-Step Resolution The MCP server\u0026rsquo;s how_entity_resolved() function shows the complete timeline:\nStep 1: CORP_FILINGS + SANCTIONS Match Match Key: +NAME+PHONE (Rule: CNAME_CFF - Close Name, Close Features First)\nNAME Match (Score: 90)\nCORP_FILINGS: \u0026ldquo;ВАСІЛЬЕЎ Аляксандр Паўлавіч\u0026rdquo; (Belarusian Cyrillic) SANCTIONS: \u0026ldquo;ВАСИЛЬЕВ Александр Павлович\u0026rdquo; (Russian Cyrillic) Why matched: Cyrillic name transliteration variance (Belarusian vs Russian) ВАСІЛЬЕЎ ↔ ВАСИЛЬЕВ (different Cyrillic spelling of same name) Same underlying person, different script conventions PHONE Match (Score: 90)\nCORP_FILINGS: \u0026ldquo;+7(4812)85-62-34\u0026rdquo; SANCTIONS: \u0026ldquo;(4812)85-62-34\u0026rdquo; Why matched: Same Russian phone number, different formatting +7 is Russia country code (4812) is Smolensk area code 85-62-34 is local number Resolution Decision: DEFINITIVE MATCH → Merged into Entity 91\nStep 2: CUSTOMERS Added to Merged Group Match Key: +NAME+PHONE (Rule: CNAME_CFF)\nNAME Match (Score: 90)\nExisting entity: \u0026ldquo;ВАСІЛЬЕЎ Аляксандр Паўлавіч\u0026rdquo; + \u0026ldquo;ВАСИЛЬЕВ Александр Павлович\u0026rdquo; CUSTOMERS: \u0026ldquo;Alexander Pavlovich Vasiliev\u0026rdquo; Why matched: Cyrillic to Latin transliteration ВАСІЛЬЕЎ / ВАСИЛЬЕВ → Vasiliev (standard transliteration) Аляксандр / Александр → Alexander (Belarusian/Russian to English) Паўлавіч / Павлович → Pavlovich (patronymic transliteration) PHONE Match (Score: 98)\nExisting entity: \u0026ldquo;+7(4812)85-62-34\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;(4812)85-62-34\u0026rdquo; CUSTOMERS: \u0026ldquo;481-285-6234\u0026rdquo; Why matched: Normalized phone equivalence +7 (Russia) dropped (4812) area code → 4812 Dashes vs parentheses vs plus signs normalized Core digits: 4812-85-62-34 match across all formats! Resolution Decision: DEFINITIVE MATCH → Added to Entity 91\nKey Insights from Timeline 1. Cross-Language Matching Works Senzing successfully matched:\nBelarusian Cyrillic ↔ Russian Cyrillic Cyrillic ↔ Latin transliteration Different name conventions across cultures 2. International Phone Format Normalization Three phone number formats recognized as identical:\nUS-style digits: 481-285-6234 Russian style: (4812)85-62-34 International: +7(4812)85-62-34 3. Incremental Resolution Entity built in steps:\nFirst match: CORP_FILINGS + SANCTIONS (both Cyrillic) Second match: Adding CUSTOMERS (Latin) to existing Cyrillic names 4. High-Confidence Matches All matches scored 90+ (out of 100), indicating strong evidence:\nMultiple features agreed (name + phone) Patterns consistent with known transliteration rules No conflicting information Investigation 3: Relationship Network Now let\u0026rsquo;s map out the corporate structure and relationships.\nPrompt show his relationships in a simple graph view AI Response: Network Visualization Entity 91 (Alexander Pavlovich Vasiliev) │ │ OWNS 100% ▼ Entity 90 (Mullenkrants Autoworks GmbH) │ Location: Germany │ Industry: Automotive Manufacturing │ │ PRESIDENT ▼ Entity 100014 (Faisal Siddiqui) │ Location: Pakistan │ Status: Customer + Sanctioned Network Analysis Multi-Jurisdictional Network:\nRussia/Belarus → Germany → Pakistan Person (Russia/Belarus) owns company (Germany) Company employs sanctioned person (Pakistan) All Parties Sanctioned:\nAlexander Vasiliev: Arms Trafficking (2014) Mullenkrants Autoworks: Company owned by sanctioned individual Faisal Siddiqui: Category unknown (requires investigation) Corporate Structure:\nClear ownership: 100% stake (not partial or joint) Management hierarchy: President role defined Cross-border operations: Multiple countries involved Risk Implications:\nSanctioned individual controls entire company Company may be shell corporation or front International network suggests sophisticated operation Second sanctioned individual in management raises red flags Compliance Impact: This network would trigger enhanced due diligence requirements:\nKnow Your Customer (KYC) violations Anti-Money Laundering (AML) concerns Sanctions compliance issues Potential need to freeze accounts and report to authorities Investigation 4: Understanding Match Logic For any two entities, you can ask Senzing to explain the matching logic.\nPrompt explain why Entity 91 and Entity 90 are related AI Response Relationship Type: REL_POINTER (disclosed relationship, not inferred match)\nSource: Ownership record from FTM data\nOwner: Alexander Vasiliev (Entity 91) Asset: Mullenkrants Autoworks (Entity 90) Percentage: 100% Role: OWNER_OF Not a Resolved Match: This is a declared relationship from source data, not a match Senzing discovered. The FTM Ownership record explicitly stated this ownership structure.\nWhy This Matters:\nREL_POINTER relationships come from your data Senzing preserves and indexes them for network analysis Different from entity resolution matches (which Senzing infers) Common Investigation Patterns Finding Watchlist Hits Show me all entities that have both CUSTOMERS and SANCTIONS records Returns entities that are both customers and on watchlists - high-priority review cases.\nExploring Networks expand network from Entity 91 showing all relationships up to 2 degrees Shows complete network including indirect connections.\nUnderstanding Specific Matches explain why entity 91 matched with CUSTOMERS:2063 Shows exact features and scores that led to the match.\nFinding Ambiguous Cases show me entities with ambiguous matches that need review Lists cases where Senzing found multiple possible matches requiring human judgment.\nKey Learnings MCP Server Enables Deep Analysis Snapshots give you statistics MCP lets you investigate specific cases You can ask \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; questions about resolution logic Cross-Language Resolution is Powerful Senzing handled:\nCyrillic script variations (Belarusian vs Russian) Cyrillic ↔ Latin transliteration International phone format differences This works because Senzing:\nNormalizes data to standard forms Uses phonetic encoding for names Applies international format standards Relationships Tell Stories The network graph revealed:\nMulti-jurisdictional corporate structure Connections between sanctioned individuals Potential shell corporation patterns Compliance risk indicators Resolution Timelines Show Logic Understanding how entities merged helps you:\nValidate that matches make sense Identify potential false positives Explain results to stakeholders Tune matching rules if needed Next Steps You\u0026rsquo;ve now completed the full watchlist mapping and analysis workflow!

	"content": "Lessons Learned from Watchlist Mapping This exercise demonstrated advanced entity resolution concepts using real-world watchlist data. Here are the key lessons you should take away.\n1. Complex Data Requires Different Strategies CSV vs JSON: More Than Format Customer CSV (Exercise 1):\nFlat structure, one row = one entity Single-pass processing No relationships English-only data FTM Watchlist (Exercise 2):\nNested JSON, multiple schema types Multi-pass processing (masters → metadata → relationships) Explicit relationships (ownership, directorship) International data (Cyrillic, Arabic, Latin) The Lesson: Your mapping strategy must match data complexity. There\u0026rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all approach.\n2. Interactive Mapping Beats One-Shot Prompts Quality Comes from Dialogue Throughout Stage 4 (Mapping), you questioned AI assumptions:\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure those are all the identifier types?\u0026rdquo; → Led to discovering nested identifier records AI missed\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t companies have relationships as well?\u0026rdquo; → Found company-to-company ownership patterns\n\u0026ldquo;Previous name should be name_org, not name_full\u0026rdquo; → Corrected convention error that would have degraded matching\nThe Lesson: AI is knowledgeable but not infallible. Your questions and corrections produce higher quality results than passively accepting first responses.\n3. Validation Has Layers Multi-Stage Validation Catches Different Issues Validation Tool What It Checks When It Catches Errors Linter JSON syntax, required fields During development Analyzer Data source config, feature recognition, coverage Before loading Loader Actual processing, candidate matching During loading Snapshot Entity resolution quality, compression, cross-source matches After loading The Lesson: Each validation layer serves a purpose. Skipping any layer means missing potential issues that could have been caught earlier.\n4. Ask Questions BUT Manage Context The Balance: Quality vs Context Consumption Questions Improve Quality:\nVerifying identifier types found nested records AI missed Asking about company relationships discovered ownership patterns Challenging NAME_ORG correction improved matching quality But Questions Consume Context:\nEach question and answer uses tokens Long interactive sessions fill the context window The more thorough you are, the more context you use What Happened in This Exercise Interactive mapping was thorough (good!) Many questions asked to verify assumptions (good!) Data loaded successfully into Senzing (good!) AI warned: \u0026ldquo;Context ~80% full\u0026rdquo; (warning signal!) AI offered to compact the conversation (compress context to free tokens) Should have said YES to compact (action needed!) Took a chance, declined instead (bad decision!) Context hit 100% → Session reset → All context lost The Critical Lesson DO ask questions - interactive mapping produces better results than one-shot prompts.\nBUT be specific - \u0026ldquo;Are you sure those are all the identifier types, and how do you know?\u0026rdquo; is better than \u0026ldquo;Tell me everything about identifiers in general.\u0026rdquo;\nAND accept compact offers - When AI warns \u0026ldquo;Context ~80% full\u0026rdquo; and offers to compact:\n⚠️ SAY YES to the compact offer 🗜️ AI compresses the conversation history ✨ Frees up tokens to continue in same session 🔄 Preserves context while reducing token count Understanding COMPACT vs TAKE SNAPSHOT:\nThese are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT:\nCOMPACT (AI Feature):\nAI compresses/summarizes conversation to reduce tokens Lets you continue in the same session Prevents hitting 100% context limit Has nothing to do with Senzing TAKE SNAPSHOT (Senzing Tool):\nSenzing command: sz_snapshot Analyzes entities and generates statistics Creates JSON file with resolution results Has nothing to do with AI context management In this exercise: Data was loaded, ready to take snapshot (Senzing). Context hit 80%, AI offered to compact (compress conversation). Should have said \u0026ldquo;yes, compact.\u0026rdquo; Instead declined, kept going → hit 100% → session reset → all context lost.\nThe Lesson: Don\u0026rsquo;t choose between quality and safety. Ask questions AND accept compact offers when warned. At 100%, session resets automatically - no exceptions.\n5. Cross-Language Resolution is Powerful International Data is Handled Automatically Senzing Successfully Matched:\nBelarusian Cyrillic ↔ Russian Cyrillic name variants Cyrillic ↔ Latin transliterations Three phone number formats (US, Russian, international) Example: Entity 91\n\u0026ldquo;ВАСІЛЬЕЎ Аляксандр Паўлавіч\u0026rdquo; (Belarusian) \u0026ldquo;ВАСИЛЬЕВ Александр Павлович\u0026rdquo; (Russian) \u0026ldquo;Alexander Pavlovich Vasiliev\u0026rdquo; (English) How It Works:\nName normalization and phonetic encoding International format standardization Transliteration pattern recognition The Lesson: You don\u0026rsquo;t need to pre-normalize international data. Map it faithfully, and Senzing handles format and language variations during resolution.\n6. Multi-Pass Processing is Essential Some Data Can\u0026rsquo;t Be Processed Linearly FTM Processing Order:\nPass 1: Create Person and Company entities (masters) Pass 2: Merge Sanction metadata onto Person entities Pass 3: Add Ownership relationships Pass 4: Add Directorship relationships Why Order Matters:\nSanction records reference Person IDs (must exist first) Ownership records reference Company IDs Relationships require both entities to exist The Lesson: When source data has pointers/references, you need multi-pass processing. Identify dependencies and process in correct order.\n7. Features vs Payload vs Ignored Three Field Dispositions Serve Different Purposes Features (18 fields):\nUsed for entity resolution matching Examples: NAME_FIRST, PHONE_NUMBER, PASSPORT_NUMBER Affect which records merge together Payload (6 fields):\nStored but don\u0026rsquo;t affect matching Examples: SANCTION_PROGRAM, INCORPORATION_DATE Operational data for retrieval and display Ignored (7 fields):\nNot mapped to Senzing Examples: schema type indicator, relationship pointers, container fields Either structural or handled differently (relationships) The Lesson: Not all fields are created equal. Thoughtful disposition decisions balance matching quality with data preservation.\n8. Relationships Tell Stories REL_POINTER Networks Reveal Hidden Patterns Alexander Vasiliev Network:\nVasiliev (Russia/Belarus) → OWNS → Mullenkrants (Germany) → EMPLOYS → Siddiqui (Pakistan) What This Revealed:\nMulti-jurisdictional corporate structure Sanctioned individual controls company Second sanctioned individual in management Potential shell corporation pattern The Lesson: Entity resolution + relationship mapping = powerful risk and compliance insights. The network tells a story individual records hide.\n9. Compression Indicates Quality 42% Compression is Meaningful What It Means:\n159 source records → 92 entities 67 records (42%) were duplicates Significant but not excessive compression Quality Indicators:\nToo low (\u0026lt;10%): Under-matching, missing duplicates Good range (30-50%): Realistic duplicate detection Too high (\u0026gt;80%): Over-matching, false positives The Lesson: Compression rate is a quick health check. Extreme values (very low or very high) warrant investigation.\n10. Cross-Source Matches Are Gold 17 Cross-Source Matches Found Hidden Connections Categories of Matches:\nCUSTOMERS + SANCTIONS (5): Watchlist hits! High-priority review. CUSTOMERS + CORP_FILINGS (8): Customers who are company officers SANCTIONS + CORP_FILINGS (4): Sanctioned individuals with companies All three sources (1): Alexander Vasiliev case The Lesson: Cross-source matches reveal hidden risks and relationships that single-source analysis misses. This is where entity resolution provides its highest value.\n11. MCP Server Enables Investigation Beyond Statistics to Understanding Snapshots provide:\nEntity counts, compression rates, cross-source matches Aggregate statistics MCP server provides:\nSpecific entity details Resolution timelines (how entities matched) Match explanations (why features scored as they did) Relationship networks (who connects to whom) The Lesson: Use snapshots for overview, MCP server for investigation. Combining both gives you complete analysis capabilities.\n12. AI-Assisted ≠ AI-Automated Humans Make Final Decisions AI Suggested:\nInitial field mappings DATA_SOURCE codes Processing strategies You Decided:\nCorrected NAME_ORG vs NAME_FULL Verified identifier types against actual data Confirmed relationship role mappings Approved final dispositions The Lesson: AI is a knowledgeable assistant, not an autonomous agent. Your domain expertise and judgment are crucial for quality results. Question assumptions, verify against data, make final calls.\nComparing Exercise 1 vs Exercise 2 What You Should Have Learned Aspect Exercise 1 (Customers) Exercise 2 (Watchlist) Skill Developed Format Simple CSV Nested JSON Handling complex structures Workflow Step-by-step with screenshots Reference summary format Self-guided mapping Language English only Multi-language (Cyrillic, Arabic) International data handling Relationships None Ownership, Directorship Network mapping Processing Single-pass Multi-pass Dependency management AI Interaction Observed Interactive corrections Critical evaluation Context Single session Cross-session recovery Session management If you completed both exercises, you now have:\n✅ Foundation in AI-assisted mapping (Exercise 1) ✅ Advanced techniques for complex data (Exercise 2) ✅ Context recovery strategies ✅ Critical evaluation skills ✅ Real-world analysis capabilities Next Steps: Apply What You\u0026rsquo;ve Learned Ready for Your Own Data You now have the knowledge and tools to:\nMap any data source to Senzing\nUnderstand the 5-stage workflow Know when to use multi-pass processing Handle international and complex data Validate thoroughly\nUse linter for structure Use analyzer for quality Interpret results correctly Analyze results\nGenerate and interpret snapshots Investigate with MCP server Identify high-value findings Work with AI effectively\nAsk questions and verify assumptions Recover from context loss Make final decisions with confidence Additional Resources Senzing Documentation:\nEntity Specification: Full feature catalog Mapping Examples: 7 worked examples Tools Reference: Complete tool documentation Workshop Materials:\nCustomer solution (Exercise 1): Reference implementation Watchlist solution (Exercise 2): Complex data example Both can serve as templates for your data Community and Support:\nSenzing Community Forum: Ask questions GitHub Issues: Report problems Documentation: Regular updates Final Thoughts Entity resolution is both science and art:\nThe Science:\nStructured workflows (5-stage mapping) Validation pipelines (linter → analyzer → loading) Mathematical matching algorithms The Art:\nKnowing which fields to map as features vs payload Recognizing data quality issues Interpreting resolution results Telling the story hidden in the data AI Assistance:\nAccelerates the science (faster mapping, fewer errors) Augments the art (suggests patterns, explains logic) Never replaces human judgment Congratulations! You\u0026rsquo;ve completed the watchlist mapping workshop. You\u0026rsquo;re now ready to apply AI-assisted entity resolution to your own data challenges.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? Try mapping your own data! Start with the Workflow Summary (Step 1) as a guide, use the 5-stage mapping assistant, and apply the validation and analysis techniques you\u0026rsquo;ve learned.

Don\u0026rsquo;t rush through - ask questions about anything unclear!\nAsk Questions About the Table Structure The mapping table may look confusing at first. Ask the AI to explain the key elements:\nAsk Amazon Q: What does the REF column mean?\nAsk Amazon Q: What does the confidence score indicate?\nAsk Amazon Q: What is RECORD_TYPE and why does it matter?\nAsk Amazon Q: Explain the logic for NAME_FULL vs NAME_ORG\nThe AI will explain how it uses the Senzing specification to make each decision.\nReview Mapping Decisions Carefully While the AI gets many mappings correct, it can make mistakes based on limited context from your schema.\nCommon issues to watch for:\nAddress Mapping:\nThe AI might map address to ADDR_FULL based on sample values in your schema If your address field contains only street addresses, ADDR_LINE1 may be more appropriate Example correction: Tell Amazon Q: Change the address mapping from ADDR_FULL to ADDR_LINE1 Name Parsing:\nThe AI may suggest parsing customer_name into NAME_FIRST and NAME_LAST This works well if your data is consistent, but can fail on varied formats If you prefer unparsed names: Tell Amazon Q: Map customer_name to NAME_FULL without parsing Identifier Types:\nIf your data has dynamic identifier patterns (like id_type and id_number fields), verify the AI mapped all possible type codes. The schema generator only shows the most common values.\nAsk Amazon Q: What are all the possible values for id_type in the source data?\nOnce you have the complete list, verify each code maps to the correct Senzing feature:\nSSN → SSN_NUMBER DL → DRIVERS_LICENSE_NUMBER PASSPORT → PASSPORT_NUMBER NATIONAL_ID → NATIONAL_ID_NUMBER If the AI missed any codes: Tell Amazon Q: Add mapping for id_type='CEDULA' to NATIONAL_ID_NUMBER\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Worry About Perfection: Additional validation steps will catch issues during the linter stage. Focus on understanding the major decisions and correcting obvious problems. This workflow is designed to help you iterate quickly to a working result - which is the only proof that truly matters.\nReview and Approve Once you\u0026rsquo;ve asked your questions and made any corrections:\nTell Amazon Q: The mappings look good, proceed to validation\nLinter Validation The AI will generate sample JSON records and run the Senzing linter to validate the mapping structure. The AI can usually self-correct any errors, but may ask for clarification.\nYou Can Intervene: If the AI is doing something you don\u0026rsquo;t understand, press Escape and ask questions before it continues.\nCommon validation issue - REGISTRATION_DATE:\nIf your source data has a field called registration_date, the linter may flag it because Senzing has a reserved feature called REGISTRATION_DATE (for legal business incorporation dates).\nIf this happens:\nAsk Amazon Q: Does our customer registration date qualify as the Senzing REGISTRATION_DATE feature?\nThe AI will explain that customer registration dates don\u0026rsquo;t match the Senzing feature definition. The solution is to keep it as payload and rename it:\nTell Amazon Q: Rename registration_date to CUSTOMER_SINCE_DATE in the payload\nWhen validation succeeds, you\u0026rsquo;ll see confirmation:\nThe assistant confirms: \u0026quot;✅ STAGE 4 COMPLETE - Mapping validated\u0026quot;\nAdvance to Outputs When the linter validates successfully:\nTell Amazon Q: yes\nCheckpoint: Q should present a complete field disposition table with confidence scores, generate valid sample JSON, and pass linter validation before moving to OUTPUTS.\n"

This can cause mapper code to fail or produce incorrect output. Always verify this count matches!\nKey Observations 1. Arrays Everywhere Notice every field is an array of strings. FTM format supports multiple values for most attributes:\nMultiple names (legal name, aliases, previous names) Multiple addresses (home, business, historical) Multiple identifiers (passport from multiple countries) Implication for mapping: Need to iterate through arrays when mapping to Senzing.\n2. Overloaded Field Names Some field names appear in multiple schema types with different meanings:\nname - Used in Person, Company, Sanction previousName - Used in Person and Company entity - References different types depending on schema Implication for mapping: Need schema-aware mapping logic.\n3. Nested Relationship Pointers Fields like entity, owner, asset, director, organization contain IDs referencing other records, not actual data.\nImplication for mapping: Need multi-pass processing to resolve these references.\nValidation Checkpoint Before proceeding, verify:\n✅ AI extracted exactly 31 fields (not 30, not 32) ✅ AI performed integrity check showing counts match ✅ All field categories are shown (Root, Person, Company, Relationship, Sanction, Identifier) ✅ Data types are noted (mostly arrays of strings) If the count is wrong: Stop and ask the AI to re-extract fields. Review the schema file manually to identify what was missed or hallucinated.\nCommon Issues and Solutions Issue Cause Solution Wrong field count AI hallucinated or skipped fields Ask AI to re-count and verify against schema Missing field categories Incomplete schema analysis Request AI list all record types in schema No integrity check shown AI skipped validation step Explicitly request: \u0026ldquo;Verify your field count\u0026rdquo; Fields from different dataset AI using training data Remind AI: \u0026ldquo;Extract only from ftm_schema.md\u0026rdquo; Next Stage With a complete field inventory verified, proceed to Stage 3: PLANNING where you\u0026rsquo;ll determine DATA_SOURCE codes and entity type strategy.\nContinue to Stage 3: PLANNING →\n"

This is exactly the kind of error you should catch and correct!\nYour prompt:\nYou say 3 master entity types but list 2: person and company. What is the third? AI Response:\nYou\u0026#39;re absolutely correct - that was an error on my part. Let me correct the Stage 2 summary: CORRECTED: 2 master entity types (Person, Company) 3 relationship types (Sanction, Ownership, Directorship) I conflated \u0026#34;master entities\u0026#34; with \u0026#34;relationship types\u0026#34;. Thank you for catching that! Key Learning: Always verify AI counts and categorizations. Simple arithmetic errors can indicate deeper misunderstandings that will cause problems later.\nFinal Strategy DATA_SOURCE Codes Two separate DATA_SOURCE codes reflect the different domains:\nSANCTIONS\nAll Person entities (33 records) Represents watchlist/sanctions domain RECORD_ID format: sanctions-person-{id} CORP_FILINGS\nAll Company entities (6 records) Represents corporate registry domain RECORD_ID format: corp-filings-company-{id} Why separate DATA_SOURCE codes? This allows Senzing to track which system contributed which information. When a Person from SANCTIONS matches a director in CORP_FILINGS, you can see both sources in the resolved entity.\nProcessing Strategy: Multi-Pass The FTM data requires three-pass processing because some records are metadata or relationships:\nPass 1: Master Entities\nProcess all Person and Company records Create Senzing records with REL_ANCHOR Pass 2: Sanction Metadata\nMatch Sanction records to their Person entities (via entity field) Merge sanction attributes as payload onto existing Person records Pass 3: Relationships\nProcess Ownership and Directorship records Add REL_POINTER relationships to existing entities Pass 4: Identifier Records (if present in data)\nMerge identifier details onto Person entities Entity Type Determination PERSON entities:\nAll records from Person schema type RECORD_TYPE: \u0026quot;PERSON\u0026quot; in Senzing output ORGANIZATION entities:\nAll records from Company schema type RECORD_TYPE: \u0026quot;ORGANIZATION\u0026quot; in Senzing output Validation Checkpoint Before proceeding to field mapping, confirm:\n✅ Two DATA_SOURCE codes identified: SANCTIONS, CORP_FILINGS ✅ Two master entity types: Person (PERSON), Company (ORGANIZATION) ✅ Three relationship/metadata types: Sanction, Ownership, Directorship ✅ Multi-pass processing strategy understood ✅ Arithmetic errors corrected (2 master types, not 3) Key Planning Decisions Explained Why SANCTIONS and CORP_FILINGS? SANCTIONS:\nPrimary source is watchlist/sanctions data Even persons not directly sanctioned are in a sanctions-related dataset Makes it clear this data comes from compliance/risk domain CORP_FILINGS:\nCompanies come from corporate registry information Separates legal entity data from person data Allows tracking which company information came from which filing Why Not All One DATA_SOURCE? You could use a single DATA_SOURCE like \u0026ldquo;FTM_WATCHLIST\u0026rdquo;, but separating by domain provides benefits:\nClearer data provenance (which system contributed what) Better cross-source matching visibility Easier debugging when issues arise More accurate record counts by source system Why Multi-Pass Processing? Single-pass processing won\u0026rsquo;t work because:\nSanction records reference Person IDs that must exist first Ownership records reference Company IDs Directorship records reference both Person and Company IDs Processing in passes ensures all referenced entities exist before relationships are added.\nCommon Issues and Solutions Issue Cause Solution Too many DATA_SOURCE codes Over-segmentation Group by logical source system, not record type Unclear entity vs metadata Confused relationship types Ask: \u0026ldquo;Does this become its own Senzing entity?\u0026rdquo; Single-pass assumption Missed relationship pointers Check for fields that reference other record IDs Arithmetic doesn\u0026rsquo;t match AI counting error Verify counts against schema file Next Stage With the high-level strategy confirmed, proceed to Stage 4: MAPPING where you\u0026rsquo;ll make field-by-field disposition decisions.\nContinue to Stage 4: MAPPING →\n"

Here\u0026rsquo;s the summary:\nSummary Counts Features: 18 fields mapped to Senzing matching features Payload: 6 fields mapped to payload attributes (stored, not matched) Ignored: 7 fields (containers, pointers, type indicators) Key Mapping Decisions Person Entity Features Source Field Senzing Feature Notes firstName NAME_FIRST Standard name feature middleName NAME_MIDDLE Standard name feature lastName NAME_LAST Standard name feature name (full) NAME_FULL When first/middle/last not available alias NAME_FULL (usage: ALIAS) Known aliases previousName NAME_FULL (usage: MAIDEN) Former names birthDate DATE_OF_BIRTH Standard demographic gender GENDER Standard demographic address ADDR_FULL Full address strings email EMAIL_ADDRESS Contact feature phone PHONE_NUMBER Contact feature passportNumber PASSPORT_NUMBER + PASSPORT_COUNTRY Identifier feature idNumber NATIONAL_ID_NUMBER + NATIONAL_ID_COUNTRY Identifier feature taxNumber TAX_ID_NUMBER + TAX_ID_COUNTRY Identifier feature Company Entity Features Source Field Senzing Feature Notes name NAME_ORG Organization name previousName NAME_ORG (usage: PRIOR) CORRECTED (see below) jurisdiction ADDR_COUNTRY Country of incorporation incorporationDate (Payload) See discussion below Payload Attributes (Not Used for Matching) Source Field Payload Attribute Reason nationality NATIONALITY Operational data country COUNTRY Operational data weakAlias WEAK_ALIAS Low confidence, don\u0026rsquo;t match on it incorporationDate INCORPORATION_DATE Operational data Sanction fields SANCTION_* Metadata merged onto Person entities Relationship Handling Ownership and Directorship records:\nNot mapped to features or payload Converted to REL_POINTER relationships in mapper code Roles: OWNER_OF, PRINCIPAL_OF, PRESIDENT_OF Interactive Corrections During this stage, several important corrections were made based on questions and data verification:\nCorrection 1: Identifier Types Your Question:\nAre you sure those are all the identifier types, and how do you know? AI Initial Response:\nI assumed based on the schema fields (passportNumber, idNumber, taxNumber). Your Challenge:\nYou should check the actual source data, not just the schema. AI Verification: After checking actual FTM records, the AI found nested identifier records:\n1 Driver\u0026rsquo;s License record → Maps to DRIVERS_LICENSE_NUMBER + DRIVERS_LICENSE_STATE 2 SSN records → Maps to SSN_NUMBER Critical Lesson: Always verify AI assumptions against actual data! The schema showed general identifier fields (idNumber, passportNumber), but nested identifier records had specific types that required different Senzing features.\nCorrection 2: Company Relationships Your Question:\nI didn\u0026#39;t see any rel_pointers in the json examples, don\u0026#39;t companies have relationships as well? AI Initial Response:\nOwnership records show owner→asset (person owning company). I didn\u0026#39;t check company→company ownership. Your Discovery: After checking actual data, you found:\nUniversal Exports Worldwide owns 3 subsidiary companies Company-to-company ownership relationships exist All use REL_POINTER_ROLE = \u0026quot;OWNER_OF\u0026quot; Key Learning: Don\u0026rsquo;t assume relationship patterns. Check actual data to find all variations:\nPerson → Company (directorship) Person → Company (ownership) Company → Company (ownership) Correction 3: Relationship Roles Your Question:\nWhat are my options for assigning roles to relationship pointers? AI Response: Based on the Senzing specification, standard roles include:\nPerson ↔ Organization:\nEMPLOYED_BY PRINCIPAL_OF OWNER_OF DIRECTOR_OF Organization ↔ Organization:\nBRANCH_OF DIRECT_PARENT ULTIMATE_PARENT Your Decision:\nUse PRINCIPAL_OF for principals and PRESIDENT_OF for presidents Final Role Mappings:\nAll Ownership → \u0026quot;OWNER_OF\u0026quot; Directorship with role=\u0026ldquo;Principal\u0026rdquo; → \u0026quot;PRINCIPAL_OF\u0026quot; Directorship with role=\u0026ldquo;President\u0026rdquo; → \u0026quot;PRESIDENT_OF\u0026quot; Role Precision: Using specific roles (PRESIDENT_OF vs generic DIRECTOR_OF) provides better relationship clarity and supports more precise network analysis.\nCorrection 4: Previous Names for Organizations Your Correction:\nprevious name should be name_org, not name_full AI Response:\nYou\u0026#39;re absolutely right! For organizations, previous names should use NAME_ORG, not NAME_FULL. NAME_FULL is for person names. Corrected Mapping:\nCompany previousName → NAME_ORG with usage type PRIOR Senzing Convention: NAME_FULL is for people, NAME_ORG is for organizations. Using the wrong feature can degrade matching quality.\nQuestion 5: Company Identifiers Your Question:\nAren\u0026#39;t there any identifiers for companies? AI Response: After checking the actual FTM data, no company identifier fields were found in this dataset. Companies only have:\nOrganization name Previous names Jurisdiction (country) Incorporation date Dataset-Specific: Not all datasets have all field types. This watchlist happens to lack company identifiers (tax IDs, registration numbers). Other datasets might include them.\nComplete Mapping Table Here\u0026rsquo;s the final mapping table after all corrections:\nPerson Entities (SANCTIONS) FTM Field Senzing Disposition Feature/Attribute Usage Type id Required RECORD_ID - schema Required RECORD_TYPE = \u0026quot;PERSON\u0026quot; - firstName Feature NAME_FIRST - middleName Feature NAME_MIDDLE - lastName Feature NAME_LAST - name Feature NAME_FULL - alias Feature NAME_FULL ALIAS previousName Feature NAME_FULL MAIDEN birthDate Feature DATE_OF_BIRTH - gender Feature GENDER - address Feature ADDR_FULL - email Feature EMAIL_ADDRESS - phone Feature PHONE_NUMBER - passportNumber Feature PASSPORT_NUMBER + PASSPORT_COUNTRY - idNumber Feature NATIONAL_ID_NUMBER + NATIONAL_ID_COUNTRY - taxNumber Feature TAX_ID_NUMBER + TAX_ID_COUNTRY - nationality Payload NATIONALITY - country Payload COUNTRY - weakAlias Payload WEAK_ALIAS - Nested Identifiers SSN identifier Feature SSN_NUMBER - Driver\u0026rsquo;s License Feature DRIVERS_LICENSE_NUMBER + DRIVERS_LICENSE_STATE - Merged Sanctions program Payload SANCTION_PROGRAM - authority Payload SANCTION_AUTHORITY - reason Payload SANCTION_REASON - listingDate Payload SANCTION_LISTING_DATE - status Payload SANCTION_STATUS - Relationships REL_ANCHOR Feature REL_ANCHOR_DOMAIN + REL_ANCHOR_KEY - Ownership/Directorship Feature REL_POINTER_DOMAIN + REL_POINTER_KEY + REL_POINTER_ROLE - Company Entities (CORP_FILINGS) FTM Field Senzing Disposition Feature/Attribute Usage Type id Required RECORD_ID - schema Required RECORD_TYPE = \u0026quot;ORGANIZATION\u0026quot; - name Feature NAME_ORG - previousName Feature NAME_ORG PRIOR jurisdiction Feature ADDR_COUNTRY - incorporationDate Payload INCORPORATION_DATE - Relationships REL_ANCHOR Feature REL_ANCHOR_DOMAIN + REL_ANCHOR_KEY - Ownership Feature REL_POINTER_DOMAIN + REL_POINTER_KEY + REL_POINTER_ROLE - Validation Checkpoint Before proceeding to Stage 5, verify:\n✅ All 31 fields have a disposition (Feature, Payload, or Ignored) ✅ Identifier types verified against actual data (not just schema) ✅ Company relationship patterns identified ✅ Relationship roles assigned (OWNER_OF, PRINCIPAL_OF, PRESIDENT_OF) ✅ NAME_ORG used for organization names (not NAME_FULL) ✅ REL_ANCHOR and REL_POINTER strategy defined Key Learnings from This Stage 1. Verify Assumptions The AI will make reasonable assumptions, but always verify against actual data:\nIdentifier types weren\u0026rsquo;t in the schema fields - they were in nested records Company-to-company relationships weren\u0026rsquo;t obvious until checking the data 2. Domain Knowledge Matters You caught important errors that would have degraded matching:\nNAME_ORG vs NAME_FULL for organizations Specific relationship roles vs generic ones 3. Interactive Mapping is Best This wasn\u0026rsquo;t a one-shot prompt. It was an interactive dialogue:\nAI proposed mappings You questioned assumptions AI verified against data You confirmed or corrected Repeat until mapping is complete This produces much higher quality mappings than asking AI to \u0026ldquo;just do it all.\u0026rdquo;\nNext Stage With field mappings finalized, proceed to Stage 5: OUTPUTS where the AI generates mapper code, documentation, and sample JSON.\nContinue to Stage 5: OUTPUTS →\n"

Finding structural errors early prevents having to fix broken mapper code later.\nValidation Checkpoint Before running the mapper on actual data, verify:\n✅ README.md contains usage instructions ✅ ftm_mapper.md documents all mapping decisions ✅ ftm_mapper.py implements multi-pass processing ✅ Sample Person JSON with merged sanction metadata ✅ Sample Company JSON with REL_POINTER relationships ✅ Sample output passes linter validation Common Implementation Issues Issue Cause Solution Missing relationships Single-pass processing Implement multi-pass: masters first, then relationships Array indexing errors Assuming single values Always iterate: for value in array: KeyError exceptions Missing field checks Use .get(field, []) for optional fields REL_POINTER to non-existent entity Pass ordering wrong Process targets before pointers NAME_FULL used for companies Copy-paste from Person code Use NAME_ORG for organizations Key Learnings from This Stage 1. Multi-Pass is Essential You cannot process FTM data in a single pass because:\nSanction records reference Person IDs Ownership records reference Company IDs Relationships require both entities to exist first 2. Documentation Matters The .md mapping specification is as important as the code:\nCode can have bugs Documentation explains why decisions were made Makes mapper maintainable by others 3. Validate Early Running the linter on sample output catches issues before processing 73 records:\nMissing required fields Incorrect JSON structure Typos in feature names 4. FTM Arrays Require Iteration Every property is an array, even if most records have single values:\n# WRONG - causes errors when array is empty or has multiple values name = record[\u0026#39;properties\u0026#39;][\u0026#39;firstName\u0026#39;][0] # RIGHT - handles empty, single, or multiple values for name in record[\u0026#39;properties\u0026#39;].get(\u0026#39;firstName\u0026#39;, []): # process each name Next Steps Now that you have working mapper code and documentation:\nRun the mapper on actual FTM data Validate output with linter and analyzer tools Configure data sources in Senzing Load the data into Senzing Analyze results to see entity resolution in action Continue to Step 4: Validate Mapping →\n"
