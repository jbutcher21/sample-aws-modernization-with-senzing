This module will guide you through accessing your development environment and connecting to Amazon Q Developer, whether you're participating in an AWS-hosted event or running the workshop independently.

### Goals

In this module you will:

1. Access your development environment (cloud-based IDE or local setup)

2. Connect to Amazon Q Developer using appropriate authentication

3. Verify your setup is ready for the workshop activities

### Setup Options

You can run the workshop either as part of an AWS event or on your own. Based on your scenario, choose the relevant tab:

2. Connect to Amazon Q Developer in your IDE and the CLI using an AWS Builder ID.

To learn how to access your cloud-hosted IDE, please head to [AWS-hosted event section](21_AWS_Guided_Event)
