# Setup and Configuration

## Overview

Welcome to the setup phase! In this module, you'll access your pre-configured cloud development environment and connect to the AI tools you'll use throughout the workshop.

All software, tools, and workshop materials are already installed in your cloud environment - you just need to authenticate and verify everything is ready.

## Setup Steps

In this module you will:

1. **Join the AWS Workshop Event** - Access Workshop Studio with your event code
2. **Access Your Cloud IDE** - Log into your pre-configured code-server environment
3. **Authenticate Amazon Q Developer** - Connect to AI assistance with AWS Builder ID
4. **Configure Senzing MCP Server** - Enable AI-powered entity resolution queries
5. **Review Resources** - Bookmark important documentation and support links

Let's get started with [joining the workshop event]({{< ref "/2_Setup_Configuration/21_AWS_Guided_Event/211_JoinWorkshopEvent" >}})!
