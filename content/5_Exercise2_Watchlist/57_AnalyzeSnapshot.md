## Analyze the Snapshot for Stats and Examples

### Overview

Analyze the combined snapshot to understand how customer and watchlist entities resolved together. Look for cross-dataset matches and interesting resolution patterns.

## Generate Analysis Report

**Command to use:**

## Review Resolution Statistics

**TODO:** Instructions for reviewing combined statistics will go here.

Placeholder for:
- Total entities across both datasets
- Cross-dataset matches identified
- Watchlist hit rate
- Data source distribution
- Quality metrics

**Expected results:**
- Combined entity count (customers + watchlist)
- Statistics showing cross-dataset resolution
- Examples of watchlist matches
- Quality and coverage metrics

## Examine Cross-Dataset Resolutions

**TODO:** Instructions for reviewing cross-dataset examples will go here.

Placeholder for:
- Viewing entities that span both datasets
- Understanding why cross-dataset matches occurred
- Identifying interesting watchlist hits
- Noting cases for MCP exploration
