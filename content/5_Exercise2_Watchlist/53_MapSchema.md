## Use the Senzing Mapping Assistant

### Overview

Use the Senzing Mapping Assistant prompt with Amazon Q to map the watchlist data. This follows the same 5-stage workflow but with JSON input instead of CSV.

## The 5-Stage Workflow

The Mapping Assistant guides you through:
1. **INIT** - Load reference files and verify tools
2. **INVENTORY** - Analyze source data schema
3. **PLANNING** - Determine data source and entity types
4. **MAPPING** - Map fields to Senzing features
5. **OUTPUTS** - Generate mapper script and documentation

## Start the Mapping Assistant

**Prompt to use:**
