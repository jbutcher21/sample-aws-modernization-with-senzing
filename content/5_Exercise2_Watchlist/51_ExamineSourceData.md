## Examine the Source Data

### Overview

Examine the watchlist JSON data to understand its structure. Unlike the CSV format in Exercise 1, this data uses the FollowTheMoney (FTM) schema with nested structures.

## Locate the Source Data

The watchlist data is located at:
```
/home/ubuntu/workshop/workspace/watchlist/watchlist.jsonl
```

## Examine the Data

**TODO:** Instructions for examining the JSON file will go here.

Placeholder for:
- Opening the file in the IDE
- Understanding JSONL format (one JSON object per line)
- Reviewing the FTM schema structure
- Looking at sample entities
- Identifying nested fields and relationships

**Expected observations:**
- Number of entities: 70
- Format: FollowTheMoney (FTM) JSON schema
- International names and identifiers
- Sanctions and watchlist information
- Entity relationships

**What you should see:**
