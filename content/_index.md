## What is Entity Resolution?

![What is Entity Resolution?](/images/entity_resolution_overview.png)

Entity resolution identifies when different records refer to the same real-world entity across your data sources. Without it, your organization faces:

- **Duplicate customers** costing 10-25% of revenue through poor experiences
- **Compliance risks** from incomplete customer views
- **Missed opportunities** from fragmented data insights
- **Operational inefficiency** from manual data cleanup
