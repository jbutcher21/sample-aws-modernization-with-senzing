# Exercise 1: Customers

## Map and Load Customer Data

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll map customer data from CSV format to Senzing's entity resolution format using AI assistance. You'll then load the data into Senzing and analyze the results to see how entity resolution identifies duplicate records.

## What You'll Learn

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Examine source data to understand its structure
- Use AI to generate data schemas automatically
- Apply the Senzing Mapping Assistant workflow to create a mapper
- Validate your mapping with analysis tools
- Load data into Senzing for entity resolution
- Take snapshots and analyze resolution statistics
- Use the MCP server to understand resolution decisions

## Exercise Steps

This exercise follows a structured 8-step workflow:

1. **Examine the source data** - Understand what data you're working with
2. **Provide or create the schema** - Document the data structure
3. **Use the Senzing Mapping Assistant** - AI-guided mapping workflow
4. **Validate the mapping** - Verify output with JSON analyzer
5. **Load the data in Senzing** - Import mapped records
6. **Take a snapshot** - Capture resolution results
7. **Analyze the snapshot** - Review statistics and examples
8. **Review with MCP server** - Ask how and why questions

**Estimated Time:** 30-45 minutes
