## Map Data with the Senzing Mapping Assistant

Now you'll use the Senzing Mapping Assistant prompt with Amazon Q to guide you through the mapping process. This AI-assisted workflow takes you through 5 structured stages to create a complete, production-ready mapper.

## The 5-Stage Workflow

The Mapping Assistant guides you through:

1. **INIT** - Load reference files and verify tools are available
2. **INVENTORY** - Analyze your source data schema
3. **PLANNING** - Determine data source name and entity types
4. **MAPPING** - Map each field to Senzing features or payload
5. **OUTPUTS** - Generate mapper script, documentation, and sample output

**Key Principle:** The AI guides you through each stage, but you make the final decisions. Answer questions thoughtfully, validate suggestions, and don't hesitate to ask "why?" about any mapping choice.
