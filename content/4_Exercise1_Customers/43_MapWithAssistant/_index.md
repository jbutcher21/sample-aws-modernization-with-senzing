## Map Data with the Senzing Mapping Assistant

Now you'll use the Senzing Mapping Assistant prompt with Amazon Q to guide you through the mapping process. This AI-assisted workflow takes you through 5 structured stages to create a complete, production-ready mapper.

## The 5-Stage Workflow

The Mapping Assistant guides you through:

1. **INIT** - Load reference files and verify tools are available
2. **INVENTORY** - Analyze your source data schema
3. **PLANNING** - Determine data source name and entity types
4. **MAPPING** - Map each field to Senzing features or payload
5. **OUTPUTS** - Generate mapper script, documentation, and sample output

{{% notice warning %}}**Key Principle:** The AI guides you through each stage, but you make the final decisions. Answer questions thoughtfully, validate suggestions, and don't hesitate to ask "why?" about any mapping choice.]{type="info"}

::alert[**AI Variability:** AI responses may differ from what's shown in this workshop. This is normal - AI models generate contextual responses based on your specific data and environment.{{% /notice %}}

**If your AI's response differs:**

1. **Follow the AI's guidance** - It's analyzing your actual data
2. **Ask clarifying questions** if something seems unclear
3. **Use the workshop examples as reference** but adapt to your AI's approach
4. **Focus on the end goal** - a working mapper that handles your data correctly
