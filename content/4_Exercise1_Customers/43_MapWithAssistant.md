## Use the Senzing Mapping Assistant

### Overview

Now you'll use the Senzing Mapping Assistant prompt with Amazon Q to guide you through the mapping process. This AI-assisted workflow takes you through 5 stages to create a complete mapper.

## The 5-Stage Workflow

1. **INIT** - Load reference files and verify tools
2. **INVENTORY** - Analyze source data schema
3. **PLANNING** - Determine data source and entity types
4. **MAPPING** - Map fields to Senzing features
5. **OUTPUTS** - Generate mapper script and documentation
