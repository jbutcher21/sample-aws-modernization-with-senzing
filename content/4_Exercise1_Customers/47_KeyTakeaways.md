## The Power of Agentic AI

Throughout this exercise, you experienced a fundamentally different way of working with development tools. Instead of memorizing commands, navigating file systems, and context-switching between documentation and implementation, you simply described what you wanted to accomplish.

### What Changed

**Traditional Workflow Friction:**
- "What directory is that file in again?"
- "What was the command syntax for this tool?"
- "Where did I save that output?"
- "What step comes next in the process?"
- "How do I format this configuration file?"

**AI-Assisted Workflow:**

You told the AI: *"Generate a schema, map the customer data, validate it, configure the data source, and load it into Senzing"*

The AI handled:
- Locating the correct tools and directories
- Constructing proper command syntax
- Managing workflow context across the conversation
- Handling environment-specific configuration
- Remembering what was done previously
- Determining the next logical step

### Time Savings Compound

The efficiency gains aren't just about individual commands - they multiply across the workflow:

- **No context switching:** Stay focused on your data and business goals
- **No documentation searches:** Tools are invoked with proper syntax automatically
- **No mental overhead:** The AI tracks what's been done and what comes next
- **Fewer errors:** Commands are constructed correctly the first time
- **Better learning:** Ask "why" questions instead of "how" questions

### This is the Promise of AI-Assisted Development

**Less time fighting with tools.** More time understanding your data and achieving results.

The technical skills - command syntax, file paths, tool options - become less critical. The conceptual skills - understanding your data, asking good questions, validating results - become more important.

**This shift lets you focus on what matters:** your data quality, your business logic, your entity resolution strategy. The AI handles the mechanics so you can focus on the meaning.

## Reflection Questions

As you continue to the next exercises, consider:

1. **What surprised you** about working with the AI assistant during this workflow?
2. **Where did you intervene** to correct or guide the AI, and why was that important?
3. **What questions did you ask** that helped you understand entity resolution concepts better?
4. **How might you apply** this AI-assisted approach to other data projects?
