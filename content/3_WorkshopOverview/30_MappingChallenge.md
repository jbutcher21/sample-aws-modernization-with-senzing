## What is Data Mapping?

Data mapping is the process of defining how data fields from a source system correspond to fields in a target system.

## Why Data Mapping is Hard

Data mapping projects face several common challenges:

**Complex schemas on both sides**
- Source systems may have dozens or hundreds of fields with unclear naming conventions
- Target systems (like Senzing) have their own complex specifications with specific requirements
- Understanding how fields relate across systems requires deep knowledge of both

**Subject matter experts are scarce**
- People who understand the source data are often too busy with operational work
- Original developers or data architects may have moved on to other projects
- Institutional knowledge about field meanings and business rules is hard to capture

**Takes a long time to understand**
- Reading through data dictionaries and specifications is tedious
- Testing mappings to verify correctness requires multiple iterations
- Edge cases and data quality issues only emerge during implementation
- Documentation is often incomplete or outdated
