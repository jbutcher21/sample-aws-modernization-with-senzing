# AWS Workshop Landing Page Guide

## Why It's Important

**First Impressions Matter**: Participants decide within seconds whether the workshop is worth their time. A clear, compelling landing page sets expectations and builds confidence.

**Lead Generation**: This is your primary opportunity to capture participant information and demonstrate value before they invest time.

**Self-Service Clarity**: For self-paced workshops, the landing page must answer all initial questions since there's no instructor present.
